      Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August
      and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.[112] He scored
      in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do
      so.[113] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two
      free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[114] His strong start
      to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October
      while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven
      weeks.[115][116] A week after his return, he received his first red card
      in Spain in a match against Almería.[117] Midway through the season,
      Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World
      Player of the Year awards, behind Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's rivals. He
      finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a
      hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La
      Liga.[118][119] His first season at Madrid ended trophyless

      Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home win over Bolton
      Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on
      as a substitute.[36] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed
      it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[30] Ronaldo
      scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win
      over Portsmouth on 1 November.[37] Three other league goals followed in
      the second half of the campaign,[38] the last of which came against Aston
      Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received
      his first red card.[39] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football
      by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004
      FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[40] BBC pundit Alan Hansen
      described him as the star of the final.[41] The British press had been
      critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in
      trying to beat a man,[42] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a
      show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world
      class player.[43]
