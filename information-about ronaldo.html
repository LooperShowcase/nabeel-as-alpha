      Return to Manchester United Ronaldo pictured on 11 September 2021 prior to
      his first game since returning to Manchester United On 27 August 2021,
      Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to
      re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and
      medical.[284] The transfer was reported as costing an initial £12.85
      million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed
      on 31 August.[285] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson
      Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[286] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt
      sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a
      transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[287] On
      11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the
      opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[288]
      On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at
      home to Villarreal in the Champions League. The match also saw Ronaldo
      overtake Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the
      competition.[289]
