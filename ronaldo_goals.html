      At the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign,
      Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and
      then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over
      Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203
      games, surpassing the club's previous recordholder, Raúl.[188] A month
      later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second
      goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total
      for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top
      scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match
      against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with
      Messi on 77 goals.[190] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30
      September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and
      country.[191] He subsequently became the first player to score double
      figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals,
      including another four-goal haul against Malmö.[192]
