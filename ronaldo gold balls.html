          The FIFA Ballon d'Or ("Golden Ball") was an annual association
          football award presented to the world's best men's player from 2010 to
          2015. Awarded jointly by FIFA and France Football, the prize was a
          merger of the FIFA World Player of the Year award and the Ballon d'Or,
          the two most prestigious individual honours in world football. Unlike
          the Ballon d'Or awarded by France Football, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, was
          not awarded based on votes from international journalists, but votes
          from national team coaches and captains, who selected the players they
          deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.The
          six editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were dominated by Lionel Messi
          and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry. Messi, who
          played for Barcelona, won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2010 and went
          on to win three in a row, after his wins in 2011 and 2012. Ronaldo,
          who played for Real Madrid, won successive awards in the next two
          years. The final FIFA Ballon d'Or was presented to Messi in 2015. Its
          awarding bodies subsequently ended their partnership; for 2016, France
          Football reintroduced the previous format of the Ballon d'Or, while
          FIFA created The Best FIFA Men's Player award.
